- A clean start / stop I2C sequence has been added on reset of i2c_master.vhd
- ucf modified for 50 ohm DCI stub to minimize potentially damaging ringing on digital lines


- Faulty temperature sensors were replaced on FPGA1 and FPGA2 of GBHSI, cause of failure unknown.

  Symptoms :
     - temperature readings allways zero
     - SDA pin only pulls up to ~2.5V rather than 3.3V

  Hypothesis:
     1) Ringing due to fast rise times on digital lines exceeds chip input ranges and eventually causes failure.
        Scope ground lead too long to prove or disprove.  Added DCI 50 ohm stub in VP30, VP40 and VP7 ucf files
     2) Bad batch of ADM1023 chips
     3) Overheating during soldering
