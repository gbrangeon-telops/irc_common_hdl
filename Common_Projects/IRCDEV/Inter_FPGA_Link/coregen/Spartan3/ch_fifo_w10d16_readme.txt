   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

ch_fifo_w10d16.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

ch_fifo_w10d16_fifo_generator_v4_4_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

ch_fifo_w10d16_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

ch_fifo_w10d16_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

ch_fifo_w10d16_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
