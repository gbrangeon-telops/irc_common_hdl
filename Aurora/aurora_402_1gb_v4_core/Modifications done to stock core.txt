Here are the modifications done to the core generated by CoreGen:

1-Change from 400M clock to 200M clock:
--> Change RXPLLNDIVSEL from 10 to 20 in GT11 generic map
--> Change TXPLLNDIVSEL from 10 to 20 in GT11 generic map
--> Change RXFDCAL_CLOCK_DIVIDE from "TWO" to "NONE" in GT11 generic map
--> Change TXFDCAL_CLOCK_DIVIDE from "TWO" to "NONE" in GT11 generic map

2-These changes were NOT observed when comparing Aurora v2.6 @ 200M and @ 400M, they were therefore NOT applied. 
--> Change RXRCPADJ from "011" to "010" in GT11 generic map
--> Change RXVCODAC_INIT from "0000101001" to "1001010001" in GT11 generic map
--> Change VCODAC_INIT from "0000101001" to "1001010001" in GT11 generic map

3-Implement Answer Record #25469 (register USRCLK_STABLE):

4-Registered TXPMA_READY and RXPMA_READY signals as suggested by Rajesh Kumar Adla and Answer Record #25470
