** DDR controller modifications
********************************************************************************

Here are the modifications done on "MIG v1.7 DDR DIMM 1GB x4 s-rank CL3 BL4"
controller to support dual-rank DDR DIMM memory modules, and to use the direct
clocking method used in the DDR2 controller. These modifications are based on
the difference between single rank and dual rank MIG DDR2 DIMM memory
controller, and between DDR and DDR2 controllers direct clocking.
