   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

fp_addsub_float32.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

fp_addsub_float32.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

fp_addsub_float32.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

fp_addsub_float32_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

fp_addsub_float32_floating_point_v4_0_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

fp_addsub_float32_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

fp_addsub_float32_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.
