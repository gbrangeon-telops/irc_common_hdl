   Please see the core data sheet.

div_w24x9_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

div_w24x9_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

div_w24x9_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
