* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a ecm  08/31/01 First release
* 1.00b jhl  02/21/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
* 1.00b rmm  05/13/03 Fixed diab compiler warnings relating to asserts
* 1.01a jvb  12/13/05 I changed Initialize() into CfgInitialize(), and made
*                     CfgInitialize() take a pointer to a config structure
*                     instead of a device id. I moved Initialize() into
*                     xgpio_sinit.c, and had Initialize() call CfgInitialize()
*                     after it retrieved the config structure using the device
*                     id. I removed include of xparameters.h along with any
*                     dependencies on xparameters.h and the _g.c config table.
* 1.01a wsy  05/08/06 fix CR220811 and CR224103.

*
* @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to the XUartLite instance.
* @param	Config is a reference to a structure containing information
*		about a specific UART Lite device. This function initializes an
*		InstancePtr object for a specific device specified by the
*		contents of Config. This function can initialize multiple
*		instance objects with the use of multiple calls giving different
*		Config information on each call.
* @param 	EffectiveAddr is the device base address in the virtual memory
*		address space. The caller is responsible for keeping the address
*		mapping from EffectiveAddr to the device physical base address
*		unchanged once this function is invoked. Unexpected errors may
*		occur if the address mapping changes after this function is
*		called. If address translation is not used, use

*		address instead.
*
* @return
* 		- XST_SUCCESS if everything starts up as expected.
*
* @note		The Config pointer argument is not used by this function,
*		but is provided to keep the function signature consistent
