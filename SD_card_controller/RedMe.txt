Introduction:
=============
This project is about SD card R/W.
It have been compiled and tested on the FX12 Mini-module dev board.
You can find the files from this board here:
F:\Bibliotheque\Electronique\PCB\EFP-00162-001 (FIRST MC Heater Autofocus)\Documentation\Datasheets\Mini module Virtex4FX12


Software projects:
=================
For all software projects use Windows Terminal at 9600, 8-bit, 1-bit stop, no parity and no HW control.

sd_raw: This is a project that allow you to write a ramp to a given sd card block, read it back and compare.
        You can also uncoment the section of code that allows erasing of the entire block. Open Windows terminal
        to see the printouts.
        
sd_uart : This project allow you to read-out an entire block to windows terminal by entring the block number in format
	 of 0000 (4 digits).
	 
sd_dosfs: This is a light implementation of DosFS to be able to read a file that was writing by the PC on FAT16/32 sd card.
	 You need to format sd card to FAT16/32 using DosFs utility tool and put some files into it. This program will read-out on Windows terminal 
	 the data that is on this file.

SD card formating:
=================

Format the SD card using the mkdosfs.exe tool utiliy:

For FAT16:	mkdosfs - v -n VolumeName
For FAT32:	mkdosfs - v -F 32 -n VolumeName
