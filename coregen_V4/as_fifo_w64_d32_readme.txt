as_fifo_w64_d32_fifo_generator_v3_2_xst_1.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist. The logic implementation of
   certain CORE Generator IP is described by a combination of a top
   level EDN file plus one or more NGC files.

as_fifo_w64_d32.edn:
   Electronic Data Netlist (EDN) file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

as_fifo_w64_d32.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

as_fifo_w64_d32.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

as_fifo_w64_d32.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

as_fifo_w64_d32_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

as_fifo_w64_d32_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.
