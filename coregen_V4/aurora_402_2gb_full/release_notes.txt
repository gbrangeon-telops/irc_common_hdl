RELEASE NOTES
=============

This section lists the enhancements and known issues associated with  
this release.

1. Enhancements 

   * Updated for ISE 8.1i
   * Calibration blocks added for Virtex-4
   * make_aurora.pl has more flexible options for synplify
   * Simpler ucf files: parameters defined in HDL


2. Known Issues 

   * Avoid using REFCLK for multilane ProX designs. There are problems in map and par that prevent them from working
   * Avoid using MGTs in col0 and col1 in a singe V4 core. These do not route well
   * Note that the calibration block makes V4 simulations run longer. You will have to run for about 180 us
   * Remember to set pin constraints in the aurora_sample.ucf file before using the aurora_sample design.
